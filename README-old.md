# Learn How To Use Git

## Checking for Git

To see if you already have Git installed, open up your terminal application.

If you're on a Mac, look for a command prompt application called `Terminal`.
If you're on a Windows machine, open the windows command prompt or `Git Bash`.
Once you've opened your terminal application, type `git version`. The output will either tell you which version of Git is installed, or it will alert you that git is an unknown command. If it's an unknown command, read further and find out how to install Git.

## Install Git on Windows

1. Navigate to the latest Git for Windows installer and download the latest version.
2. Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided in the Git Setup wizard screen until the installation is complete.
3. Open the windows command prompt (or Git Bash if you selected not to use the standard Git Windows Command Prompt during the Git installation).
4. Type git version to verify Git was installed.
